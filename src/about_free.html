                <h3>ABOUT</h3>
                Free Step is a dance that consists of sliding on the floor movements with their legs and hands under the beats of electronic
                music. The dance is based on elaborate and quick movements, and to include other dance styles such as Melbourne
                Shuffle, Jumpstyle and C-Walk.
                <h3>HISTORY</h3>
                <p>
                    The Free Step is the evolution of ancient Rebolation , which is the evolution of another foreign dance called Charleston
                    Dance (dance that move the legs, listening to a kind of blues as music), the Brazilian saw, he liked
                    and adapted to electronic music creating rebolation. The dance turned fun between young and was very
                    successful in Rave parties in Brazil by 2008 and 2009, following the Dance genre was based on the Psy
                    Trance and rhythms. In late 2009, it saw the need to create new steps for the dance, as the Rebolation
                    was very limited steps forward and back, there was not much variation. The Rebolation then underwent
                    a makeover, making the most elaborate steps mainly by the use of hops in their own base. Also in late
                    2009, the band called Axe Music Parangolé created a song called Rebolation, inspired by dance, but implying
                    that it was based on rebolados of ax and not the movement of the legs. The music was very successful
                    in Brazil and with it the general association of the population was made between the Parangolé and Rebolation,
                    constraining who said that danced Rebolation. The name "Free Step" was given by "dancers" of this type,
                    and was very successful, especially the Internet. Today there are competitions called "Meet Up" in which
                    dancers compete with each other, being judged for innovation, timing, perfection and creativity in the
                    sequences.
                </p>
                <h3>KEY MOVEMENTS</h3>
                <ul>

                        sideways. Normally when you use the Base, the dancer tends to move in the direction in which the
                        step is executed. With training develops the ability to make a base on the spot where it is. With
                        more training still manages to make a base in any direction you want, but few achieve this feat.</li>
                    <li><b>Hand moves: </b> The hand movements complement the steps with his legs, are usually inspired Tecktonik
                        style.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Kicks: </b>The kicks are used very often to increase base.</li>
                    <li><b>Spins: </b>The spins (spins) are also widely used and in different ways, tend to have a more attractive
                        visual effect but requires more experience of the dancer to use them.</li>
                    <li><b>Combos: </b>Sequence of predefined free movements such as hand moves, kicks and spins, and may even
                        enter footsteps of other dances</li>
                </ul>
